put log.py and upload.py into the collector class
modify scheduler to work with the new layout and access the class instead of the YAML config. Remove the utility class from scheduler, add funtionality to collector class (collector.py)
^^ maybe not remove the class, we need to scheduler to execute the collector which is on its own process and will not be able to load its variables, just load from it's yaml

investigate moving the upload daemon to a thread inside the collector object

start moving away from bash and into python, remove bash_config --> change to global_config.py

add uploaded status boolean to all database entries! have post_database.py edit entry and change flag
create another daemon to add unqueued entries to the upload queue
create another daemon to remove entries inserted at a specified time interval
